= `mkdir -p` is POSIX (now)

Using `mkdir -p` is one of the most useful ways to create a directory because you never have to worry about the directory existing, which is why some years back I was really troubled to discover that it _was not_ POSIX compatible. In fact, people were using it on our IBM project that strictly forbade anything not POSIX.

Well I was happy to be informed by `swills6` on Twitch that the `-p` is now officially POSIX, which explains why `ash` on Alpine had it when I checked.
