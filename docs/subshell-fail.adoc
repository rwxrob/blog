= Subshell fail

_Saturday, January 4, 2025, 9:00:00AM EST_

I used to think that by encapsulating everything in any of my shell scripts into a function and calling it at the end of the script was a good thing even though it meant there would be a forced subshell execution. Here's an example:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Outputs the seconds since the thing identified by the first argument
# was last modified (not created).

ageof() {
	local path="$1"
	if [[ -z "$path" ]]; then
		echo 'usage: ageof <path>'
		return 1
	fi
	echo $(($(date +%s) - $(date -r "$path" +%s)))
}

ageof "$@" # OMG WHY THE SUBSHELL FOR NO REASON!!
----

I'm mortified with embarrassment for doing this.

My logic was that I could easily `daf` the function into other stuff later. But by just having it as a single command I can simply remove the shebang line and include it just as easily and give it a name that is better fitted for whatever I'm putting it in.

Honestly, however, if it is reusable code should either stay a single command or be written in Go in a more reusable way.
