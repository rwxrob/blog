= Perl chomp is dead

_Saturday, January 4, 2025, 9:50:12AM EST_

After a very frustrating fight with new Perl having lost a lot of knowledge about it I learned that the age-old `chomp` in Perl is still there but for some reason is  not as dependable. I'm sure it has something to do with the `$/` the `$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR` which is normally `\n` and now that I'm on several different types of systems (macOS and Linux) it just doesn't behave correctly. I specifically hit this in my `buildadoc` script (posted earlier).

Rather than use it I use the Unicode white space `\R` instead. That's right, good 'ol `\S` has been replaced with one that is Unicode aware.

#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.36;
my $pwd = `pwd`;
$pwd =~ s/\R$//;    # better than chomp
my ( $parent, $name ) = $pwd =~ m,/([^/]+)/([^/]+)$,m;
say "$parent-$name.txt"
