= Building AsciiDoc

_Saturday, January 4, 2025, 9:37:10AM EST_

Here's the latest script that I use to build this site and content.

[source,shell]

[NOTE]

The script is updated every time I build so might not reflect the date of this blog post.

== Different formats

You'll see that `asciidoc` gets run four times:

. HTML site with TOC
. HTML site without TOC
. PDF
. EPUB

I could add any other formats that I need.

== Calculate hours

I have hours calculation built into the current default. I'll probably remove that later since not everything has hours in it. That was specifically for link:https://github.com/rwxrob/coding-from-the-get-go[_Coding from the Get Go_]. It is nice to have though for other things. As the volume of text gets larger though it might have to go.
