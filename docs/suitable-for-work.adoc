= Suitable for work

_Sunday, January 5, 2025, 1:00:30PM EST_

I've decide to _attempt_ to make this channel 100% suitable for work from now on, even when writing in my blog about stuff that is really hard to write about without really going off on. I have a bunch of scrubbing of the blog posts I have made so far. This way if someone wants to put the stream up on their TV at home or in the office they shouldn't have to worry about it, well, more than the average YouTube channel that is.
