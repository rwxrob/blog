= 2025
[small]#Wednesday, January 1, 2025, 12:02:14PM EST#

Here we are in a new year. I'm a sucker for setting goals and reviewing them after the fact. Sipping coffee and eating a waffle with my wife while she writes in her shiny new 2025 journal. Sam is lounging on the patio in the sun. Seems like 2025 is going to be a great year.

== Goals

- Hour a day outside: bike, paddle, hike
- Get new teeth
- Finish book: _Terminal Velocity_
- Finish book: _Coding from the Get Go_

== Events

- Son's college graduation in Idaho
- Son's stay with us in apartment

Changes:

- Books now available in PDF and EPUB automatically
- Reward hard-working readers over lazy viewers
- One blog post per day
- Daily cycling at sunset
- Mostly SCREEN mode livestreaming
- YouTube update videos
- Perl over bash for small scripts

== Banishing Bash

- Not as flexible or ubiquitous as POSIX
- Safer than POSIX but not as safe as `perl -T`
- Bloated with completely unnecessary stuff (100x > perl)
  - `-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   1.2M Aug  4 06:31 /bin/bash`
  - `-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   134K Aug  4 06:31 /usr/bin/perl`
- Sloooow, really slow (one reason `dash` was invented)
- Only integer math support
- Dependence on other external tools for text processing
- Bashisms aren't really that great
- Extended regular expressions are absolutely grotesque
- Using `/bin/sh` _is_ `/bin/bash` on some systems but POSIX limited

== Pumping up Perl

> "Perl is, by and large, a digested and simplified version of Unix. Perl is the Cliff Notes of Unix. I could never really get myself to learn sed, awk, zsh, grep, find, m4, pipes, xargs, tee, cut, paste, yacc, lex, various IPC or even C for that matter. I ought to. In practice, in almost all cases I use perl." - Larry Wall
