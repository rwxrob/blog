= Join fields with bullet

_Monday, January 6, 2025, 5:24:20PM EST_

Yeah, `awk` isn't anywhere near as amazing as this 42 character `bullets` Perl script:

[source,perl]
----
include::../../dot/scripts/bullets[]
----

== What does it do?

This little script will take every whitespace-separated word on a line and join them with bullets.

- `-p` → Read each line, process it, and print it automatically.
- `-a` → Auto-split the line into the `@F` array using whitespace as the delimiter.
- `$_ = join " • ", @F` → Reconstruct the line by joining each field with a fancy bullet `•`.

[source,text]
----
foo bar baz
hello world perl
----

Becomes:

[source,text]
----
foo • bar • baz
hello • world • perl
----

== Using it in Vim/Neovim

While I could do something like this in Vim:

[source,vim]
----
:.!perl -pa -E '$_ = join " • ", @F'
----

Putting it into a `bullets` executable script is better since it integrates perfectly into Vim or Neovim without any unnecessary plugins. Run it on a line (`!!bullets`), section (`!}bullets` or `!apbullets`) or whole file (`:%!bullets`).

If you are going to do a lot of this, map to a Vim/Neovim keybinding:

[source,lua]
----
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>jb', ':.!bullets <CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
----

Now, every time you hit `<leader>jb`, the current line gets bulletized. For me, I just use the other filter commands because they work everywhere and I can create my own pipelines. But maybe you are doing  _a lot_ of bulleted joining.

== Editor independence

A filter command doesn’t care whether you’re in:

- Vim
- Neovim
- Nano
- Emacs
- A plain shell session

It just _works_. Lua plugins and other editor extensions, on the other hand, are trapped by their editors. They can’t participate in shell pipelines or be reused across different tools.

== Not just for editing

When deciding between a Lua plugin for Neovim and a command-line filter, the real power of any command executable filter comes down to _composability_.

Filters like our bullet-joining one-liner are not locked into _one editor_ or _one use case_. They live in the shell, where they can:

- Be combined with other commands in pipelines
- Process input from files, pipes, or other scripts
- Run in batch mode across thousands of files

For example, you could easily chain the bullet filter with `grep`, `sort`, or any other Unix tool:

[source,shell]
----
grep '^foo' file.txt | bullets | sort -r > output.txt
----

This pipeline:

. Filters lines starting with `foo`
. Applies the bullet transformation
. Sorts the output in reverse
. Writes the result to a file

_No Lua plugin can do this._

== A philosophy, not just a tool

When you use a command-line filter one-liner:

- You're embracing the Unix philosophy: "Do one thing, and do it well."
- You're keeping your tools _composable_ and _interoperable_ across any system, shell, or editor.

Lua plugins are great for in-editor enhancements such as syntax highlighting, linting, fixing, or displaying keystrokes during a live stream, but when it comes to raw power and flexibility, commands win every time.
